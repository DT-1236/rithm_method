        I was born in the Philippines and emigrated to the US in 1990. I occasionally visit, but I have few memories from there. I grew up in the Chicago area and studied chemistry at a small liberal arts institution called Knox College in Galesburg, IL. There, I met my future wife, Naomi, in the choir.

        After graduation, I worked in a medical research laboratory in Chicago, developing Pancreatic Cancer models. I managed the lab and ran experiments for 5 years. I experienced many aspects of the scientific process. In 2014, Naomi was accepted to medical school at the Medical College of Wisconsin, so we moved to Milwaukee!

        There, I worked as a medical scribe alongside MDs as they treated patients in the Emergency Department. I wrote medical notes from scratch and learned to type very quickly. It was around then that I found I enjoy working with computer science logic constructs. In time, decided to pick up Python and find a job in the medical tech sector.

        I started working for DART Chart helping nursing homes interpret patient contracts and bill appropriate amounts from insurance companies. There, I developed tools to help analysts be more efficient, and assist integrations with increasing our information base. Then, in the summer of 2018, Naomi graduated medical school... So we drove our '93 Camry out to San Francisco!

        I worked remotely with DART Chart for a smooth transition to the Bay Area. Moving forward, I seek to solidify my foundations as a software developer with Rithm, and leverage my experience in medicine and research to find a solid role in Health IT
